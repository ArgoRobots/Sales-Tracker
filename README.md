# Sales Tracker

## Introduction
**Argo Sales Tracker** is a simple, powerful, and effective C# WinForms application designed to track the sales and purchases of products. It was created out of the need for a one-time payment solution, as most existing sales trackers are subscription-based, overpriced, and overcomplicated. Argo Sales Tracker offers advanced features while remaining easy to use, filling the gap between basic spreadsheets (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets) and enterprise-level software.

- **Accountants Integration**: Keep track of accountants working with the sales data.
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and organize your products with ease.
- **Receipts and Exporting**: Generate and export receipts and sales data for your records.
- **Custom Date Ranges**: Filter sales and purchases by custom date ranges.
- **Charts and Analytics**: Visualize your data using charts to gain insights into sales trends and performance.
